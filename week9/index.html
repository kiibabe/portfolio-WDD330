            <h2>Week 09</h2>
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
                <h4>Javascript: Novice to ninja</h4>
                <h4>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>BOM (Browser Object Model) contains info about the browser and computer screen</li>
                    <li>The window object is a global object in a browser environment</li>
                    <li>Alert dialog messages can be invoked through the window object</li>
                    <li><code>window.navigator</code> property has info about what browser is being used to run the code</li>
                    <li><code>window.location</code> has info about the current URL and the different properties within it can break up the URL into pieces (like host, protocol, and port)</li> 
                    <li><code>window.history</code> has info about previously accessed pages in the current browser session</li>
                    <li>The window object has methods to open, close and control the browser window size</li>   
                    <li>Screen information can be received from the <code>window.screen</code> property (like height, width)</li>     
                    <li>The document object, contained in the window object, has to do with the page itself like the content and cookies</li>  
                    <li><code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> are two methods that let the user time certain functions and add delays to code</li>  
                    <li>Those methods can be used to create animations by modifying the css based on the timer</li>             
                </ul>


                <h4>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and has new features that make development easier</li>
                    <li>The data-attribute can be used to insert data in a page that is ignored by the browser</li>
                    <li>The data can be accessed via the dataset property in each element</li>
                    <li>When referencing data in the dataset property, the data- prefix is dropped (for example, data-dropdown would be accessed like such: element.dataset.dropdown)</li>
                    <li>Localstorage and sessionstorage can be used to store data locally in the browser</li> 
                    <li>Storage events are fired each time changes are made to the web storage</li>
                    <li>Geolocation API can get the geographical location of the device accessing the page, including coordinates, speed, altitude, and heading</li>   
                    <li>Web workers allow users to run multiple processes in the background, like a thread</li>     
                    <li>Shared web workers can be used by multiple scripts on the same domain, and service web workers can intercept network requests</li>  
                    <li>Websockets allows for push messaging, where the connection between client and server is kept open</li>  
                    <li>Notifications can be controlled, as well as asking for and granting permissions to display notifications</li>     
                    <li>Multimedia (like video and audio) can be added easily via &#60;video> and &#60;audio> tags</li>
                    <li>The canvas element allows for graphics like lines and shapes to be drawn in it</li> 
                    <li>Shims/polyfills allow older browsers to also use the new APIs without issues by filling in missing code automatically without the user needing to code anything extra</li> 
                </ul>
